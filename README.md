# What is this?

This is a collection of cards, designed for the game [Kingdom Duels](https://kingdomduels.carrd.co/). It uses [Magic Set Editor](https://magicseteditor.boards.net/) files to define the cards, so this should only be opened up in that program, using the existing MSE template provided on the [Kingdom Duels website.](https://kingdomduels.carrd.co/#duel)

## Aren't there a bunch of cards from the main sets here?

Yes, as a matter of fact! To aid in cohesiveness, cards that appear in the main and story sets for Kingdom Duels are directly duplicated.
This allows for cards that reference a single card to know that they are indeed, referencing that card, and not another card with a different, potentially more useful effect.

## What is the OutputImages folder?
That is meant for images to be directly referenced by Tabletop Simulator, allowing for live updates, before this is completely converted into a full addon.

## What are the Holographic Overlays for?
If, by chance, we ever start using full on Unity Asset Bundles for individual cards, the holographic overlays would help define what parts of a card's image should have the holographic shimmer. The brighter the pixel, the stronger the holographic effect should be on that part of the card.
